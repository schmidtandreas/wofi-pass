Since `wofi` isn't a drop-in replacement for `rofi`, I couldn't use 
[rofi-pass](https://github.com/carnager/rofi-pass) anymore. So, I just made a 
version of `passmenu` that accomplishes everything I needed from `rofi-pass`. 

## What does it do?
This script uses [wofi](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi) and 
[wtype](https://github.com/atx/wtype) to provide a completely 
Wayland-native way to conveniently use [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/). 
It provides the same search that `passmenu` does, but shows a second dialogue 
that lets the user choose which field to copy/print.

It also assumes that [pass-otp](https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp) is 
installed if an `otpauth://...` string is present in a password file.

The script assumes password files are formatted like the following:
```
Th3Gr3at3stPassw0rd
username: JohnDoe
email: john@example.com
otpauth://totp/example?secret=ABCDCBABCDCBABCD
pin: 1234
```
Note that the password is **ALWAYS** on the first line.

The `-s | --squash` flag tells `wofi-pass` to "intelligently" skip 
the field choice dialogue when there is only a password in the file.

The `-t | --type` flag tells `wofi-pass` to type the choice instead of copying 
to clipboard. This also enables the autotype choice which types 
`username :tab password`.

## Configuration

wofi-pass can read its configuration values from various locations in the following order:
* `WOFI_PASS_CONFIG` (environment variable)
* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wofi-pass/config`
* `/etc/wofi-pass.conf`

If `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable is not set, `${HOME}/.config` will be used.

wofi-pass loads only the first existing file. If no configuration file exists, wofi-pass uses its internal defaults.

An example configuration file can be found in the supplied `wofi-pass.conf` file.
